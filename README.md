# pymetric
Originally whipped together to capture ping times and send to
graphite for graphing in grafana, but can be used as an example to collect other things

# usage

* copy the sample config file
* run the program

```
# python pymetric.py
# cp  pymetric_config_sample.py pymetric_config.py
```
